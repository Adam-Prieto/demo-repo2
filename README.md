### Git Terminal Commands Used
clear -- clears terminal\
git add . -- prepares all files for pushing to github\
git status -- gets status of branch (is it up to date, committed, etc.)\
git commit -m " < message here > " -- commits files with message\
git push -u < remote destination > -- pushes all files to a remote github repo\
git checkout -b " < branch name here > " -- creates a new branch\
git checkout < branch name here > -- switches branch\
git log --graph -- displays a commit graph of the contributions in the terminal. 

### Note
My screenshot was unable to capture the entire commit history as the commit graph was too large; having said that, 
please accept a screenshot of part of the graph and a .txt file with the entire commit graph. Both documents can be 
found in the repository.
